# rolemining
Role-based access control (RBAC) defines the methods complex organizations use to assign permissions for
accessing resources to their users. RBAC assigns users to roles, and roles define the resources each user
can access. Defining roles when there is a large number of users and many resources to handle could very
hard. Hence, data mining techniques can be used to automatically propose candidate roles. The class of
class of tools and methodologies to elicit roles starting from existing user-permission assignments are
referred to as role mining. Sometime, to let the RBAC model directly deployable in organizations,
role mining can also consider various constraints like cardinality and separation of duty. In general,
constraints are enforced to easy rolesâ€™ management and their use is justified as role administration
becomes convenient.

We concentrate on the User-Distribution cardinality constraint. Such a constraint assumes
that only a maximum number of users can be assigned a given role. In this scenario, we present a simple
heuristic (DuplicateUDCC) that improves over the state of the art ones. Moreover, to consider a more realistic scenario,
we propose to add another constraint to the User-Distribution model. Namely, we impose that the role
mining procedure cannot generate two roles having the same set of permissions. We also describe a heuristic (StrictUDCC)
to compute a solution in the new model. Heuristics' performances have been evaluated using real-world datasets. The 
Python code available in the folder UDCC implements both heuristics.
